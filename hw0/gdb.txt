GDB Practice:

a. cgdb map

b. b 15 (sets breakpoint at line )

c. run

d. 

  * argv is an array of strings. In this case the length of argv is 1 since argc = 1. 

	If one executes:

	p argv
	$1 = (char **) 0x7fffffffe4d8

	0x7fffffffe4d8 is the memory address which points to the first string "map".

e.

  * If one executes:

	p *argv
	$3 = 0x7fffffffe711 "/home/vagrant/code/personal/hw0/map"

	we find that "/home/vagrant/code/personal/hw0/map" is at the address of argv. 

f. Use the command next to step until recur.  

g. 

  * We can get the address of the function recur by doing 

  p recur
  $2 = {int (int)} 0x5555555546cd <recur>

  The address of recur is at 0x5555555546cd. 

h. Run "step"

i. Reached the if statement.

j. I DON'T KNOW

k. I DON'T KNOW

l. I DON'T KNOW
